# Ocean Analytics Dashboard

A Django-based dashboard for visualizing and analyzing oceanographic and soil moisture data. The application provides interactive visualizations of dissolved iron measurements in ocean waters and soil moisture readings from various forest sites.

## üìä Overview

This application serves two main purposes:
1. Visualize and analyze dissolved iron (DFe) measurements across different ocean locations, depths, and time periods
2. Track soil moisture levels across different forest density sites (MDF, LDF, HDF) over time

Key features:
- Interactive time series visualizations
- Data filtering capabilities
- Paginated data tables
- User authentication system
- Admin interface for data management

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Choose either pip or Anaconda for installation:

#### Option 1: Pip Installation
- Python 3.11+
- pip
- virtualenv
- SQLite3

#### Option 2: Anaconda Installation
- Anaconda or Miniconda
- Git

### Required Data Files
Due to file size constraints, the following data files are not included in the repository. You must provide these files:

1. Place these files in the `ocean_analytics/data_src/` directory:
   - `Dissovled Iron.csv` (~265 rows, ~0.1MB)
   - `dg_soil_moisture.csv` (~1.2M rows, ~544MB)

The application expects these exact filenames and specific column structures:
- Dissolved Iron CSV: cruise, datetime, lat, lon, depth, dfe, rrs_443
- Soil Moisture CSV: timestamp, year, doy, hour, minute, site, m_soil, sensorZ

source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create .env file in project root
```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

5. Run migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Import data
```bash
python manage.py import_iron_data
python manage.py import_soil_moisture
```

7. Create superuser (optional, for admin access)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

8. Run the development server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## ü§î Design Decisions & Assumptions

### Data Models
- **IronMeasurement**: Stores dissolved iron measurements with associated metadata (cruise, location, depth)
- **SoilMoisture**: Tracks soil moisture readings across different forest sites
- Both models include database indexes on frequently queried fields for performance

### Authentication
- Basic user authentication implemented for future access control
- Currently, most views are publicly accessible
- Admin interface requires authentication

### Performance Considerations
- Pagination implemented (20 items per page) to handle large datasets
- Database indexes on frequently filtered fields
- Efficient database queries using Django's ORM
- Chart data aggregated at the database level

### Data Import
- Custom management commands for importing CSV data
- Handles missing values and data validation
- Bulk create operations for efficient imports

### Frontend
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- Chart.js for interactive visualizations
- Client-side date formatting for consistent display

## üîÑ Data Refresh

To update the data:
1. Ensure your new CSV files match the expected column structure
2. Place the files in the `ocean_analytics/data_src/` directory:
   - `Dissovled Iron.csv`
   - `dg_soil_moisture.csv`
3. Run the import commands:
```bash
python manage.py import_iron_data
python manage.py import_soil_moisture
```

Note: The import commands will clear existing data before importing new data.

## ü§î Assumptions

### Data Structure and Format
1. Dissolved Iron Dataset:
   - Small dataset (~265 rows)
   - Contains columns: cruise, datetime, lat, lon, depth, dfe, rrs_443
   - Primary metric of interest is Rrs_443 over time
   - Depth values are meaningful for analysis
   - Cruise identifiers are useful for filtering

2. Soil Moisture Dataset:
   - Large dataset (~1.2M rows, ~544MB)
   - Contains columns: timestamp, year, doy, hour, minute, site, m_soil, sensorZ
   - Data organized by monitoring sites (e.g., MDF1, MDF2, LDF2)
   - Timestamps can be constructed from year, doy (day of year), hour, and minute
   - Missing values are possible and should be handled gracefully

### Performance and Scaling
1. Data Loading:
   - Soil moisture data requires chunked processing due to size
   - 5000 records per chunk is optimal for memory usage
   - Bulk create operations with 1000 records per batch
   - Garbage collection needed between chunks

2. Data Display:
   - 20 records per page is sufficient for iron measurements
   - 50 records per page is appropriate for soil moisture
   - Charts can effectively display up to 1000 data points
   - Time-based aggregation needed for meaningful visualizations

### Security and Access
1. Authentication:
   - All data views require user authentication
   - Admin interface needed for data management
   - Basic user roles (admin/non-admin) are sufficient
   - No sensitive personal data in datasets

### Visualization Requirements
1. Iron Measurements:
   - Line charts best represent Rrs_443 trends
   - Additional visualizations for depth ranges and monthly trends
   - Filtering by cruise, date range, and depth is sufficient

2. Soil Moisture:
   - Both time series and site comparison views needed
   - Daily aggregation appropriate for trend analysis
   - Site-based comparisons are valuable
   - Filtering by site and date range meets user needs

### Technical Environment
1. Database:
   - SQLite sufficient for development
   - Indexes needed on datetime, site, and cruise fields
   - Database can handle the full dataset size

2. Browser Support:
   - Modern browsers with Chart.js support
   - JavaScript enabled
   - Responsive design required for various screen sizes

These assumptions guided the implementation decisions and may need to be revisited as requirements evolve or usage patterns emerge.
